# Coursera-Deep-Learning-Specialization
 This repository contains the graded programming assignments of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course. 
 The specialization contains 5 courses, such as:
 1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning)
 2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning)
 3. [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning)
 4. [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning)
 5. [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models?specialization=deep-learning)

The graded assignments are in the respective course folders and are arranged in the format of Week number and assignment number. Such as, W2A1 means Week 2 Assignment 1.
